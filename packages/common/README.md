# bag3d-common â€“ common resources, utilities and types for the 3D BAG pipeline

This package contains the resources, functions and type definitions that are used by the 3D BAG packages that define the data processing workflows.
Therefore, this package is meant to be a dependency of the workflow packages and does not contain data assets for instance.

## Install and use in dependent workflow package

Install this `bag3d-common` package manually in the virtual environment of the workflow package:

```shell
pip install 3dbag-pipeline/packages/common
```

`pyproject.toml` of the workflow package:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "bag3d-common",
]
```

For example use the resources in some `module.py` in the workflow package:

```python
from bag3d.common.resources import database

database.db_connection
```
